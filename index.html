        <p>Hello! My name is Landon White. I am a Computer Science major at Weber State University. A little about me is that I 
            have been playing soccer since I was 6 years old, I graduated from Clearfield High School in 2024 with Magna Cum Laude.
            This website will serve as my portfolio, where I present my projects for Web 1430 and maybe other classes too in the future. Thank you
            for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
